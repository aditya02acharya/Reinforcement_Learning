# Reinforcement_Learning
Implementation of popular RL algorithms running on Atari Games.

Goals:
1. Implement All DQN variant 
2. Implement REINFORCE algorithm.
3. Implement A3C and A2C.
4. Implement PPO.
5. Convert python classes under Agent into a more generic class to run on different environments.
